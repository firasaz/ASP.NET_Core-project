add this url to launchSettings.json file under profiles under WebApplication1 in applicationUrl variable.
essentially add it next to http://localhost:5140.

https://localhost:7286

another workaround this above issue is to use the IIS Express server and delete the sslPort variable.

"sslPort": 44335
